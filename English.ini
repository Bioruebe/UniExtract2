; Translation Instructions:
;	Copy this file to a new file named after the new language
;		Eg: A language file for the German language would be named German.ini.
;	Replace the English words and phrases with their native equivalents,
;		attempting to match the English phrasing and case-sensitivity as
;		closely as possible for the sake of consistency
;	Update the Author and Homepage information at the top of your new language
;		file.  Simply delete the Homepage line if you don't have one. Credit 
;		yourself in the ABOUT_INFO_LABEL term if you want to.
;	Save the file in Unicode format (UTF-16/UCS-2 Little Endian) and Zip it to preserve formatting
;	Contact the developers for inclusion in Universal Extractor
;
;	The following symbols have special meanings:
;	& - when used in a GUI label or button, it precedes the letter that will
;		be registered as a "hotkey" for that function
;	%name	  - represents a shortcut for "Universal Extractor"
;	%n	 	  - indicates a newline character
;	%t	  	  - indicates a tab character
;	%1,%2,... - indicates a string variable that UniExtract will replace when displayed
;		The content of each %1,... variable is hardcoded into UniExtract.
;		The numbered variables' order can be switched to fit your language's word order
